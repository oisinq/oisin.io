I've listened to a lot of music in the last year (see my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Oisin1001/) for proof). I know this is mostly a tech blog, but I've done a lot of work with music, from my [radio](https://mixcloud.com/quinntessentials) [shows](https://mixcloud.com/meandmyfriends) to my music website [Amhr√°n](https://amhran.ie). I thought I'd switch things up on here a bit and talk about my favourite albums of the year.
