It's very strange to think that another year is over. I can split this year into three very distinct eras: the first two months of the year were incredibly busy with [SISTEM 2020](https://sistem.intersocs.ie), followed by 4 months of cramming my final year of college, finishing off with half a year of my first full-time job.

Because of the... circumstances, I've found myself listening to a lot of music. While I spent a lot of the year listening to "lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to", I also tried my best to listen to some new music. This is the post where I'll chat about the albums I liked the most.

This year, I didn't have my finger on the pulse of new music in the same way I normally would. I found myself listening to comfort music way more often than I normally would, and I also gave the "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" challenge a go for a while thanks to [this cool site](https://1001albumsgenerator.com). I got obsessed with The Beatles for a few months at the end there when I listened to The White Album on repeat for a month.

But I still found a good few new albums that I really liked. Here's a write-up about what new albums I loved the most the most this year, and hopefully you'll find something new that you'll love.

Like last year, I'm splitting these up into vague tiers to make it clearer how much I liked a specific album. I'm going for "Favourites", "Great albums", "Good albums" and "Good albums I didn’t listen to enough". Inside each section, they're listed alphabetically by artist. Enjoy!

## Favourites

The albums I loved the most this year.

### After Hours – The Weeknd

{% include spotify_track.html id="6b5P51m8xx2XA6U7sdNZ5E" %}

This has to be my album of the year. It took me a few listens for it to click, but by god. When I heard the contrast between the sadness of _Escape From LA_ into the incredibly-egotistic braggadocio of _Heartless_, that's when it all made sense to me. There isn't a bad track on this album.

I've never been the biggest fan of The Weeknd. I've enjoyed some of his past projects but they always seemed to fall short for me. _Trilogy_ never clicked for me. _Beauty Behind The Madness_ and _My Dear Melancholy,_ bored me. I liked _Starboy_, but I thought it was really inconsistent outside of its solid start. (Also Sidewalks is a really awful Kendrick feature imo.)

Yet I absolutely adored After Hours. I think it had a really great mix of pop and hip-hop, but The Weeknd shined most on the moody R&B tracks with really beautiful, atmosphere-building synths.

I got into this album just when Ireland started to go into lockdown for the first time in March. I left my apartment in Dublin to head back home to Cavan. I was also absolutely swamped with college work. I think after a week of non-stop listening, I knew this was something very special.

Highlights:

* After Hours
* Alone Again
* Heartless

### The Avalanches – We Will Always Love You

{% include spotify_track.html id="51wxtCuipwjvvT99wsSmCc" %}

This was a bit of a late contender for this list, coming out on 11th December 2020. I liked _Since I Left You_, the band's 2001 debut album, but I didn't know what to expect going into this. I was really pleasantly surprised.

This album feels like a bit of a re-invention for the group, moving away from the unwieldy amount of samples of past albums and instead inviting loads of collaborators like MGMT, Blood Orange, Jamie xx, Kurt Vile and Rivers Cuomo.

It's a really cohesive project and the kind of album I can easily listen to the whole way through, even though it has 25 tracks that all do their own thing. Highly recommended.

Highlights:

* We Will Always Love You (feat. Blood Orange)
* Running Red Lights (feat. Rivers Cuomo and Pink Siifu)
* Take Care In Your Dreaming (feat. Denzel Curry, Tricky and Sampa the Great)

### Gorillaz – Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez

{% include spotify_track.html id="7rhtPZkcGCWgA3kizGwXwO" %}



Highlights:

* Désolé (feat. Fatoumata Diawara)
* How Far? (feat. Tony Allen and Skepta)
* Aries (feat. Peter Hook and Georgia)

### Chris Stapleton – Starting Over

{% include spotify_track.html id="3K07bGe8iljQ3mOKArHLDo" %}

I always seem to have a country phase at the end of

Highlights:

* Starting Over
* Arkansas
* Whiskey Sunrise

### Thundercat – It Is What It Is

{% include spotify_track.html id="7dZ83x0X0QnZfm1mvJ83bn" %}

I saw Anima described as an "anxious" album, and I think that fits it pretty perfectly. Listening to it makes me feel uneasy and a bit scared. This doesn't feel like a Radiohead album; it feels like something unique in its own right, the polar opposite to A Moon Shaped Pool. I haven't been the biggest fan of Thom Yorke's solo work before this, but I really enjoyed Anima more than I expected.

Recently I was in a really stressful place, and not able to think straight. I decided to close my eyes and put on this album, and somehow the terrifying anxiousness of this album calmed me down. I'm not sure what that says about it, but it really is a unique album that is one of my favourites of the year.

Highlights:

* Fair Chance (feat. Ty Dolla $ign and Lil B)
* Dragonball Durag
* I Love Louis Cole (feat. Louis Cole)

## Great albums

Albums that I really liked this year.

### Pillow Queens – In Waiting

{% include spotify_track.html id="6JWsaKAJaqznc19DLk5d00" %}

I liked Dangerous Woman and Sweetener, but Ariana Grande's album is her best yet. It's a kind of victory lap, solidifying her place as one of the biggest pop artists in the world. When I saw she was releasing a second album so soon after Sweetener, I was a bit concerned, but this album doesn't have a bad song. "NASA" is one of the best pop songs of the year, and the honestly of "fake smile" is really refreshing.

Highlights:

* Liffey
* Donaghmede
* Harvey

### Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats – UNLOCKED

{% include spotify_track.html id="1AzqpMy3yLYNITSOUrnL8i" %}

Craic Boi had a great 2019, exploding onto the Irish scene with my favourite Irish projects of 2019. His hooks are infectious and the rough-around-the-edges sound just adds to the appeal. Cork City Anthems 2 is my favourite by Craic Boi mixtape yet, and I tell that to everyone I meet. I don't love everything he puts out, but when he gets it right, he hits gold. Not for everyone, but this is definitely for me.

If you want to listen to these, YouTube has the best versions of each mixtape. Here's [Cork City Anthems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcCYOhPeJ68) and [Cork City Anthems 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYhvas5T9-s).

Highlights:

* DIET_
* Take_it_Back_v2
* 'Cosmic'.m4a

### Fontaines D.C. – A Hero's Death
{% include spotify_track.html id="4xCA8KYdeVe3AmTTEYJtVp" %}

I still think this album's really underrated. I'm not sure if it's better than GINGER, but I think it's more interesting. Looking forward to seeing more inevitable Brockhampton solo albums in the future.

Highlights:

* I Don't Belong
* A Lucid Dream
* You Said

### Taylor Swift – Folklore

{% include spotify_track.html id="1MgV7FIyNxIG7WzMRJV5HC" %}

Between this and Kacey Musgraves, I went through a country phase towards the end of the year. I don't have many thoughts on this album, but it's a really enjoyable listen. I'd recommend it if you want to give some country music with an indie touch a go.

Highlights:

* exile (feat. Bon Iver)
* my tears ricochet
* mirrorball

### The Strokes – The New Abnormal

{% include spotify_track.html id="6IRzBP4gVoV4D2zHmocoWy" %}

2019 was a pretty weak year for hip-hop, or at least hip-hop that I'm interested in. Looking back, Pivot Gang's album was probably my favourite. I've been a fan of Saba and Joseph Chilliams for a bit, and they both show up with great performances on their collective's album. Surprised that most tracks on this album have less than a million hits, considering how big Saba has gotten. The beats aren't the most diverse, but it's an enjoyable listen.

Highlights:

* Eternal Summer
* Bad Decisions
* Brooklyn Bridge To Chorus

### Gemma Dunleavy – UP DE FLATS

{% include spotify_track.html id="2CIhxbSlLKVkoG2uRIFjCc" %}

I just realised I left this off my list on Twitter and I had to include it here.

This was a pretty different album from 2016's Konnichiwa, with less hard-hitting beats and more of a mature sound, but I think I enjoyed Ignorance Is Bliss just as much.

Also I cracked up when I noticed the [Murder on the Dancefloor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAx6mYeC6pY) sample.

Highlights:

* Up De Flats
* Stop The Lights
* Cruisin

### Tame Impala – The Slow Rush

{% include spotify_track.html id="3LbZIhU0smEU5SUnxod4j4" %}

I was cynical going into this album, but in hindsight Tyler succeeded at creating something really different after 2017's Flower Boy. I didn't love this album as much as a lot of people seemed to, but I can appreciate it more now looking back outside of the hype it built.

Highlights:

* One More Year
* Breathe Deeper
* Instant Destiny

### YHLQMDLG – Bad Bunny

{% include spotify_track.html id="6NfrH0ANGmgBXyxgV2PeXt" %}

I loved the singles for this album, but didn't care for it much when it came out. In hindsight, it's actually a great comeback album for the band. It's a subtle album and doesn't try to do anything crazy, and it's not the greatest album of all time, but I can respect and enjoy it for exactly what it is: a nice, poppy indie rock album.

Highlights:

* Si Veo a Tu Mamá
* La Difícil
* Pero Ya No

## Very good albums

### Aminé – Limbo

{% include spotify_track.html id="2nWB8ZpA1lxulicEUzTQ6W" %}

I don't have anything to say about this that hasn't been said already, but this was a really good debut pop album. I don't think anyone thought Bad Guy would be as massive as it was when we first heard it on this album. (even though I still think of [Crash Bandicoot when I hear the intro](https://twitter.com/theycallmemac_/status/1111600220641652736)).

Highlights:

* Pressure In My Palms(feat. slowthai and Vince Staples)
* Fetus (feat. Injury Reserve)
* Woodlawn

### Mac Miller – Circles

{% include spotify_track.html id="4jXl6VtkFFKIt3ycUQc5LT" %}

I loved 2016's 22, A Million, so I was really hyped for this album. I enjoyed it, but I can't put it on the same level as Bon Iver's previous albums. It's fun to listen to and has some really good singles, but it doesn't hit as hard as their previous work. But when the bar is so high, even coming short results in a really good album, and I enjoyed i,i a lot.

Highlights:

* Circles
* Good News
* Blue World

### Nealo – All The Leaves Are Falling

{% include spotify_track.html id="77M6i8qTQwyphoQONpgjp2" %}

Just like ARIZONA BABY, I think GINGER is a bit underrated. I really enjoyed the singles, and No Halo is one of their best songs ever. I haven't gone back to this album much, but I still think it's an enjoyable one and better than what some hardcore fans like to say it is.

Highlights:

* Angel on My Shoulder (feat. INNERSPACE)
* Let Your Dreams Collect Dust Until You're Desperate (feat. Molly Sterling, Adam Garrett and Jehnova)
* All the Leaves Are Falling (feat. Molly Sterling)

## Good albums I didn't listen to enough

none!

There were a lot of big albums missing from this list. The main reason is that I probably haven't listened to them, or listened to them enough times for them to click with me. So if anyone has any recommendations that I missed out on, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oisinq_) and I'd be happy to check them out.
